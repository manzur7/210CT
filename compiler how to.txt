Here i explain and show how i managed to run the compiler in notepad++ 

1. installed MinGW installer and necessary c++ plugins 

2. had to modify system variables so I added the bin location into environment variables into path

3. created execute function nppexec in order to execute the code written 

4. created a script called c++
 this was the code inside the script :

npp_save
cd "$(CURRENT_DIRECTORY)"
g++ "$(FILE_NAME)" -o $(NAME_PART) -march=native -O3
NPP_RUN $(NAME_PART) 

this part of code was taken from youtube from this tutorial as this was the only way
for me which displayed the code into command prompt

5. in command prompt i wrote g++ p1.cpp -o p1.exe to run,create and display my code
